## Welcome

Hello there! 

Firstly thank you for taking the time to visit this site and for reading my first post. 

Over the last few years I have been fortunate enough to speak lots of micro business owners. One thing that struck me is just how many hats a micro business owner wears and how time consuming running a business can be. What I wasn't expecting to see was the lack of technology used to run a lot of businesses. 

Most businesses I have spoken to have accounting software but other than that a lot of businesses are often unaware of what technology exists. A phone, spreadsheets and email are all that power a lot of micro businesses and this creates a lot of inefficiencies and can limit their growth.

Coming from a career in Digital Product Management where building and using software is such a big part of my world this took me by surprise. 

Enter Mile One Ventures... My mission is to help with the adoption of technology by micro businesses by providing impartial reviews, information and sign posting. Other than that I have no idea where this journey will take me but if I can help a handful of micro businesses improve their productivity, then it will be worth it. 

If you are a micro business owner and have a question about how technology can help you, please do [ask me a question](https://www.mileoneventures.co.uk/contact/) and I will do my best to help. 

Chris
