My mission is to help micro-businesses adopt technology that increases productivity by providing updates, guides and sign posting. Here's why...

The UK has a longstanding productivity challenge; even before the financial crisis labour productivity was on average 13% higher in the rest of the G7 countries compared to the UK. This 'Productivity Gap' has since been exacerbated by the UK's unusually weak productivity growth since the financial crisis in 2007-2008.

Research commissioned from the Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) has shown that adoption of a range of basic technologies is associated with a productivity improvement of between 7% to 18%, depending on the technology. This is further backed by ONS analysis which shows the use of two or more business management technologies is associated with productivity gains of up to 25%. These technologies include accountancy software, customer relationship management systems (CRM), supply change management and enterprise resource planning software.

Low uptake of these existing technologies has been suggested as one of the reasons for the UK's relatively poor productivity performance. While the uptake of digital technologies has increased in recent years, with web-based accounting software and cloud computing being used by more than 40% of micro-businesses, the proportion of UK businesses adopting these fairly basic technologies is significantly below the EU's best performers. In 2017, the proportion of UK businesses with websites, internet trading capabilities, customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems were lower than the proportion of Danish businesses that had adopted them eight years earlier, in 2009.
